Welcome to Grubr!

This is an app that lets you discover new recipes by swiping on them similar to Tinder. It's currently only available for iOS

To get started, pull the project into your own local environment. An iOS simulator such as Xode is needed to interact with the app.
Upgrade or add the Expo CLI with the command "npm install --global expo-cli" in the root project directory.
If the command npm isn't found, please make sure Node.js is installed on your system from this page: https://nodejs.org/en

Run the app with the command "npx expo start" where you should then be prompted with instructions. Press "i" so it opens the iOS simulator.
